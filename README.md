# XG-Boost---Churn-Modeling-on-Customers-of-a-Bank
Churn Modeling is powerful way that defines the steps and stages of customer churn, or a customer leaving your service or product. Having a predictive churn model gives you awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in your retention efforts. I found this idea interesting and decided to implement this modeling on a dataset. I have used a bank dataset having 10,000 customers. The final goal of the business problem is to predict all the customers that are going to leave this bank in future. I decided to use XG-Boost algorithm as this is a powerful Gradient boosting algorithm with high speed and accurate prediction results. I have also compared the accuracy with other classification models such as SVM and Logistic Regression and XG-Boost performs the best. The accuracy further increases after tuning the hyper-parameters and performing K-fold Cross validation.
